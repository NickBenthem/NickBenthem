# 👋 Software Developer & Mathematician

Hi, I'm Nick.

I'm a hands‑on engineer who turns data problems into production‑ready code. My background blends pure mathematics with years of building scalable systems. I work across the stack: from ETL pipelines on Databricks to Supabase‑powered web apps. I focus on shipping well‑tested software, solving real-world business problems, and increasing develop velocity.

## 🔧 Core Competencies
- **Languages:** Python (primary), TypeScript/React, SQL
- **Data & Cloud:** Databricks, Snowflake, Azure & AWS, DuckDB, Delta Lake
- **Web & Realtime:** Supabase, Next.js, Vercel
- **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- **ML & LLMs:** Prompt engineering, embedding pipelines, vector search

## 📌 Recent & Ongoing Work
- **Migration Lead:** Moving a multi‑TB Snowflake workload onto Databricks, targeting >50 % compute cost reduction while maintaining SLA.
- **Database Research:** Exploring zero‑copy lakehouse architecture 
- **LLM Research:** Benchmarking parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning strategies for domain‑specific chat assistants.

## 📝 Writing
- **Technical blog:** [blog.benthem.io](https://blog.benthem.io/) – deep dives on data platforms, performance wins, and math curiosities.
<!--- **Talks & slides:** [`talks.example.com`](https://talks.example.com) - Need to fill this in!-->

## 🌐 Projects
| Project | Stack | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| [**AprioriDB**](https://www.aprioridb.com/) | Rust, SQL | Modern Data Lineage - Trace every data point, fully redact PII with justifiable trust, and audit your data pipelines without fear. |
| [**Civ6 Leader Picker**](https://civ6-picker-kappa.vercel.app/) | React, Vercel, Supabase | Web UI to choose the leader for my weekly Civ6 games |

<!---*See `/projects` for the full list.* -->

## ✅ What I’m Looking For
I enjoy roles where I can:
- Design data‑intensive backends that stay simple.
- Lead migrations or green‑field builds with measurable cost impact.
- Keep one foot in applied research (LLMs, columnar formats) and one in shipping code.

If that sounds like a fit, let’s talk!
